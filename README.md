# Neurofunk - Task & Focus Management

**Neurofunk** is a modern, desktop-focused productivity application that combines **Pomodoro time management** with **intelligent task organization**. Built with Tauri and SvelteKit, it helps you stay focused and productive through structured work sessions.

The creation of it is inspired by [Things3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) and [Session](https://stayinsession.com/) and grew out of the desire for working with time-blocking but having personally a hard time to block times in calendars as well as needing extended features than Things3 is able to offer as well as the desire for more organising capabilities than Session has to offer right now.

‚ö†Ô∏è The Project is a WIP, not well rounded yet and worked on during leisure.
